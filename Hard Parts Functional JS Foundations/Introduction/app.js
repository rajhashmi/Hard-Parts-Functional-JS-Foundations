// let's suppose we have a quize game we're building 

// Every line of code either save data to memory  (e.g a user's secore )  or user that data (e.g. a user increase that score of his )


// But with 1000s of line of code- every line of code can potentailly use (and DEPEND) on data 

// High risk- every time I want to change any line, I have to consider whether It could affect  other line  (and when I miss something, I get bugs)


// What's the answer?
